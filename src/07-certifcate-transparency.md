# Certificate transparency log

We will now install the Certificate transparency log (CTL).

CTL requires running instances of trillian's log server and signer

Let's start by logging in:

```bash
gcloud compute ssh sigstore-ctl
```

## Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
```

If you want to save up some time, remove man-db first

```bash
sudo apt-get remove -y --purge man-db
```

```bash
sudo apt-get install mariadb-server git wget -y
```

### Install latest golang compiler

Follow the [Download and install](https://go.dev/doc/install) steps to install Go (system package are often older than what Trillian requires)


### Database

Trillian requires a database, let's first run `mysql_secure_installation`

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

The script is interactive. The following snippet captures the answers to
the script's prompts:
```bash
NOTE: RUNNING ALL PARTS OF THIS SCRIPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MariaDB
      SERVERS IN PRODUCTION USE!  PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY!

In order to log into MariaDB to secure it, we'll need the current
password for the root user.  If you've just installed MariaDB, and
you haven't set the root password yet, the password will be blank,
so you should just press enter here.

Enter current password for root (enter for none):
OK, successfully used password, moving on...

Setting the root password ensures that nobody can log into the MariaDB
root user without the proper authorisation.

Set root password? [Y/n] n
 ... skipping.

By default, a MariaDB installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone
to log into MariaDB without having to have a user account created for
them.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation
go a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a
production environment.

Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y
 ... Success!

Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This
ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y
 ... Success!

By default, MariaDB comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can
access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed
before moving into a production environment.

Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y
 - Dropping test database...
 ... Success!
 - Removing privileges on test database...
 ... Success!

Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far
will take effect immediately.

Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y
 ... Success!

Cleaning up...

All done!  If you've completed all of the above steps, your MariaDB
installation should now be secure.

Thanks for using MariaDB!
```

We can now import the database as we used for rekor

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sigstore/rekor/main/scripts/createdb.sh
```

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sigstore/rekor/main/scripts/storage.sql
```

```bash
chmod +x createdb.sh
```

```bash
sudo ./createdb.sh
```

E.g.

```
sudo ./createdb.sh
Creating test database and test user account
Loading table data..
```

### Install trillian components

```bash
go install github.com/google/trillian/cmd/trillian_log_server@v1.5.1
```

```bash
sudo cp ~/go/bin/trillian_log_server /usr/local/bin/
```

```bash
go install github.com/google/trillian/cmd/trillian_log_signer@v1.5.1
```

```bash
sudo cp ~/go/bin/trillian_log_signer /usr/local/bin/
```

```bash
go install github.com/google/trillian/cmd/createtree@v1.5.1
```

```bash
sudo cp ~/go/bin/createtree /usr/local/bin/
```

### Run trillian

The following is best run in two terminals which are then left open (this helps for debugging)

```bash
trillian_log_server -http_endpoint=localhost:8090 -rpc_endpoint=localhost:8091 --logtostderr ...
```

```bash
trillian_log_signer --logtostderr --force_master --http_endpoint=localhost:8190 -rpc_endpoint=localhost:8191  --batch_size=1000 --sequencer_guard_window=0 --sequencer_interval=200ms
```

Alternatively, create bare minimal systemd services

```bash
sudo bash -c 'cat << EOF > /etc/systemd/system/trillian_log_server.service
[Unit]
Description=trillian_log_server
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=600
StartLimitBurst=5

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/trillian_log_server -http_endpoint=localhost:8090 -rpc_endpoint=localhost:8091 --logtostderr ...
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF'
```

```bash
sudo bash -c 'cat << EOF > /etc/systemd/system/trillian_log_signer.service
[Unit]
Description=trillian_log_signer
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=600
StartLimitBurst=5

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/trillian_log_signer --logtostderr --force_master --http_endpoint=localhost:8190 -rpc_endpoint=localhost:8191  --batch_size=1000 --sequencer_guard_window=0 --sequencer_interval=200ms
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF'
```

Enable systemd services

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable trillian_log_server.service
sudo systemctl start trillian_log_server.service
sudo systemctl status trillian_log_server.service
sudo systemctl enable trillian_log_signer.service
sudo systemctl start trillian_log_signer.service
sudo systemctl status trillian_log_signer.service
```

```bash
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/trillian_log_server.service ‚Üí /etc/systemd/system/trillian_log_server.service.

```

### Install CTFE server

```bash
go install github.com/google/certificate-transparency-go/trillian/ctfe/ct_server@latest
```

```bash
sudo cp ~/go/bin/ct_server /usr/local/bin/
```

### Create a private key

> **Warning**
> The following section dumps out keys into the home directory. This is only recommended if you do not greatly care about the security of this machine
> If you do care, place them into a more secure location and chmod to a secure level of file permissions.

Create a key pair with the following command:

```bash
openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out unenc.key
openssl ec -in unenc.key -out privkey.pem -des3
```

Extract the public key from the key-pair:

```bash
openssl ec -in privkey.pem -pubout -out ctfe_public.pem
```

Feel free to remove the unencrypted key:

```bash
rm unenc.key
```

> **Note**
> The private key needs a passphrase, remember it as you will need it for `your_passphrase` when we create the `ct.cfg` further down.

> **Note**
> You will need the ctfe_public.pem file for the TUF root of cosign, with the sign-container section towards the end

### Create a Tree ID

> **Note**
> `trillian_log_server` needs to be running for this command to execute

```bash
LOG_ID="$(createtree --admin_server localhost:8091)"
```

### Set up the config file

```bash
cat > ct.cfg <<EOF
config {
  log_id: ${LOG_ID}
  prefix: "sigstore"
  roots_pem_file: "/etc/ctfe-config/fulcio-root.pem"
  private_key: {
    [type.googleapis.com/keyspb.PEMKeyFile] {
       path: "/etc/ctfe-config/privkey.pem"
       password: "your_passphrase"
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

Afterwards, open the file again and change `<your_passphrase>` to the one you used
when generating the private key.

> **Note**
> `fulcio-root.pem` is the root ID certificate, we created in [06-fulcio](06-fulcio.md).

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/ctfe-config/
sudo cp ct.cfg /etc/ctfe-config/
sudo cp fulcio-root.pem /etc/ctfe-config/
sudo cp privkey.pem /etc/ctfe-config/
```

### Start the CT log

```bash
ct_server -logtostderr -log_config /etc/ctfe-config/ct.cfg -log_rpc_server localhost:8091 -http_endpoint 0.0.0.0:6105
```

> üìù The `-http_endpoint` flag uses the internal private IP. We don't need this facing externally
  (for this tutorial at least)

You may create a bare minimal systemd service

```bash
sudo bash -c 'cat << EOF > /etc/systemd/system/ct_server.service
[Unit]
Description=ct_server
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=600
StartLimitBurst=5

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ct_server -logtostderr -log_config /etc/ctfe-config/ct.cfg -log_rpc_server localhost:8091 -http_endpoint 0.0.0.0:6105
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF'
```

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable ct_server.service
sudo systemctl start ct_server.service
sudo systemctl status ct_server.service
```
